        "Code debugging is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors in a program to ensure it functions correctly and efficiently. It involves detecting syntax, logic, and runtime errors using debugging tools, breakpoints, logging, and stepwise execution. Developers often use techniques like unit testing and code refactoring to improve code reliability and maintainability. Modern debugging also integrates AI-powered tools for faster issue resolution. Effective debugging is essential for producing high-quality, error-free software.",

      eventDescription:
        "Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find hidden pieces of information called 'flags.' These competitions help improve hacking, programming, and security skills. CTFs are categorized into three main types: Jeopardy-style, which involves solving puzzles related to cryptography, forensics, and reverse engineering; Attack-Defense, where teams defend their systems while trying to hack others; and Mixed, which combines both formats. CTFs are widely used for learning ethical hacking and are hosted by universities, companies, and security organizations. Popular platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe offer practice challenges. Many cybersecurity professionals start their careers by participating in CTFs, as they help develop problem-solving and practical hacking skills. Some well-known CTF events include DEFCON CTF, PicoCTF, and Google CTF. Whether a beginner or expert, CTFs provide a fun and competitive way to learn about cybersecurity and ethical hacking.",
